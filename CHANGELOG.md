## 2026-07-23

- **Added** `analysis/delta_onset/` (new scoped workspace, with `CLAUDE.md`) — investigation of the professor's hypothesis that at EEG delta-burst onset a *preceding* event appears in CAP bands 0–0.5 / 0.5–1 / 1–3 Hz (CLE/CRE/CH). `delta_onset_detection.py` builds and validates the delta-onset trigger: Schmitt-trigger burst detector on the EEG delta (0.5–4 Hz) Hilbert envelope (per-session robust NREM baseline med±MAD, high=+2·MAD/low=+0.5·MAD, ≥4 s sustained), onset walked back to the burst rising edge, ≥25 s refractory, kept only if in NREM with a motion-clean −30→0 s pre-window. Caches EEG delta envelope + per-sample stage codes + motion mask to `$TEMP/delta_onset_cache` for fast re-tuning. Writes per-session onset npz, `delta_onsets_summary.csv`, and overview + single-event-gallery figures to `analysis/delta_onset/outputs/`. CLI `-s/--session`, `--show`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/delta_onset/delta_onset_detection.py`. Cohort: 11–197 onsets/session, 100% NREM, N2-dominant.
- **Changed** `analysis/delta_onset/delta_onset_detection.py` — added `REQUIRE_QUIET_PRE` EEG-quiescence gate (per user decision): an onset is kept only if the mean EEG delta envelope over the full −30→0 s pre-window is below the `low` threshold (near baseline), so every retained trial is a genuine quiet→delta transition. Records `pre_env_mean` per onset. Effect: counts drop sharply (S2N1 197→99, S2N2 181→80) and N3 onsets nearly vanish (0–1/session) — the gate structurally selects isolated N2 slow-wave/K-complex onsets, because N3's sustained delta has no quiet baseline to rise from. Several sessions now thin (S5N1=1, S4N2=4, S5N2=6, S1N2=9).

- **Changed** `analysis/mean_value/channel_evolution.py` — (1) baseline-velocity row (D) now reports a **continuous, motion-regressed velocity**: the block-level accelerometer is regressed out of the baseline before differentiation (OLS on per-axis accel MEAN = gravity/head-orientation, which drives the sensor-coupling baseline, + movement magnitude accel std), then d(mean)/dt smoothed. No epochs are cut/blanked — the trace is gap-free (per user: "don't cut the signal, regress motion out"). Large electrode coupling-loss steps (e.g. poor-contact S6) are NOT accelerometer motion, so they legitimately remain. (2) Spectrogram row (F) annotates the **respiratory (0.1–0.5 Hz)** and **cardiac (0.5–3.0 Hz)** bands with dashed lines + labels.

## 2026-07-21

- **Added** `analysis/mean_value/channel_evolution.py` — per-session, per-channel journal figure of overnight signal evolution. One stacked panel per channel (CLE, CRE, CH) with rows A–F: hypnogram strip, mean value, variance, smoothed baseline velocity, motion (accelerometer std), and a 0–5 Hz spectrogram with dB colorbar. The raw channel is zero-phase low-pass filtered at 10 Hz (Butterworth-4) before mean/variance so those reflect physiological-band content, not the >10 Hz electronic floor. Mean/variance/motion from 10 s blocks; velocity = smoothed d(mean)/dt (3-min baseline smooth, 2-min velocity smooth); every data row autoscaled to robust 1–99th-pct limits so evolution isn't squished; faint per-stage shading behind line rows. CLI `--session <label>` or `--all`. Outputs `writeup/figures/channel_evolution/<SESSION>_<channel>.png` (12 sessions × 3 channels = 36). Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/mean_value/channel_evolution.py --all`.
- **Added** `analysis/mean_value/abs_mean_vs_stage.py` — absolute (native a.u.) CAP mean-value vs sleep-stage analysis, the complement to the z-scored slow-mean scripts. Consumes the raw a.u. columns already in `reports/mean_value/mean_value_epochs.csv` (no raw reload for stats); controls the between-session DC offset by subtracting each channel's per-session Wake median (preserves a.u. scale, unlike z-score). Computes: between-session offset spread, within-night drift (last-30min − first-30min), per-session-centered per-stage medians + Kruskal–Wallis, and per-subject Wake/N3 sign consistency. Loads the 3 representative sessions (S1N1/S3N1/S5N1) for a raw-a.u. trace + low-freq spectrogram figure. Outputs `reports/mean_value/abs_mean_{scale, stage_au, subject_direction}.csv` and figs `notebooks/plots/mean_value/abs_{baseline_by_session, stage_boxplot_au, scale_comparison, trace_<SESSION>}.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/mean_value/abs_mean_vs_stage.py`.

## 2026-07-16

- **Added** `writeup/figures/signal_validation/psd_db_per_session.py` — simple frequency-vs-dB power-spectrum plot of the CAP signal, per session. x = frequency (Hz, 0–20), y = power in dB (`10*log10` of the full-night Welch PSD); CLE−CRE differential bold + CH/CLE/CRE faint; resp (0.1–0.5) and cardiac (0.5–3.0 Hz) bands shaded. Reuses the cached PSDs in `signal_characterization_cache.pkl` (no raw reload). Outputs a 4×3 all-sessions grid `psd_db_all_sessions.png` + one PNG per session under `psd_db/`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe writeup/figures/signal_validation/psd_db_per_session.py`.
- **Changed** `sleep_monitor/harmonics.py` — added a backward-compatible `min_freq` parameter to `detect_persistent_ridges` (default 0.0, so existing callers are unaffected). It band-limits the Welch frequency mask (`(f<=max_freq)&(f>=min_freq)`) and the ridge-frequency floor (`min_ridge_freq_floor = max(min_freq, 2*df)`), enabling per-band ridge detection (respiratory 0.1–0.5 Hz, cardiac 0.5–3.0 Hz).
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/band_ridge_analysis.py` — runs `detect_persistent_ridges` twice per session×channel, band-restricted to the respiratory (0.1–0.5 Hz, 30 s periodogram, jump 0.05) and cardiac (0.5–3.0 Hz, 8 s Welch, jump 0.10) bands, over all 12 sessions × 3 CAP channels; per-epoch ridge features (n_ridges, min/mean ridge freq, total power, freq spread, harmonic groups, ridge_present) aligned to PSG stage; KW + N3-vs-rest MWU + per-subject direction (pooled on CRE). Outputs `reports/slow_wave/{band_ridge_epochs.parquet (55,914 rows), band_ridge_stage_summary.csv}`, figs `writeup/figures/harmonics/{band_ridge_by_stage.png, band_ridge_overlay_S1N1.png}`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/slow_wave/band_ridge_analysis.py`.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/band_ridge_figure.py` — reloads `band_ridge_epochs.parquet` (no recompute) and renders the paper figure `band_ridge_by_stage.png` (2 bands × {mean active ridges bar, total ridge power box, lowest ridge freq box} by stage, KW p-values) and prints the citable numbers used in §4.3. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/slow_wave/band_ridge_figure.py`.
- **Edited** the canonical manuscript `writeup/main/CAP_sleep_mask_manuscript_main.docx` directly (unzip → edit `word/document.xml` via lxml → rezip via `zipfile`; no LibreOffice/pandoc on this machine). Per user request: removed the negative within-session rate-tracking section (Results §4.3, Methods §3.6, Discussion subsection, Figs 6–9, Table 4), the LOSO N3 classification subsection (Fig 12, Table 5, Methods sentence, Discussion subsection), and the SEC-vs-contact-EEG SWA negative section (Results §4.5, Methods §3.8, Discussion subsection, Figs 13–14, Table 6, uncited Lucey ref #30); trimmed the broadband harmonic/ridge Methods+Results and rewrote §4.3 as "Harmonic structure and band-restricted ridge features" with the resp/cardiac band results, swapping the embedded pooled-harmonic image (media/image12.png, rId17; cy set to 2926080 EMU for the 2700×1440 PNG) for `band_ridge_by_stage.png`. Fixed all cascading cross-refs and renumbered Methods 3.6–3.7 / Results 4.1–4.4 / Figures 1–8 / Discussion 5.1–5.5. Clean edit (no tracked changes — prior redline already accepted); XSD-validated (`validate.py`, PASSED, 629→475 paragraphs). Pre-edit backup `CAP_sleep_mask_manuscript_main_PRE_NEGATIVE_REMOVAL_backup_20260716.docx`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/spindle_lowband_subbands.py` — breaks the CAP 0–3 Hz spindle-onset bump into sub-bands 0–0.5 / 0.5–1.5 / 1.5–3 Hz (CH), onset-triggered average per N2 spindle, all 12 sessions. Same ±8 s window + own-baseline dB contrast as `spindle_lowband_detection.py` but finer STFT (nperseg=256 → 0.39 Hz bins) so the sub-bands resolve. Recomputes from raw sessions, caches onset-triggered curves to `analysis/spindles/outputs/spindle_lowband_subbands.npz` (pass `--recompute` to rebuild). Figure: grand-mean panel + 12-session grid, per-session title flags which sub-band peaks. **Finding: the bump is broadband across 0–3 Hz — all three sub-bands rise at onset** (grand-mean core dB: slow +0.47/11·12, mid +0.52/11·12, high +0.37/12·12); slow (0–0.5 Hz) has the largest, most sustained excursion, high (1.5–3 Hz) the flattest/earliest — consistent with a mechanical/hemodynamic transient, not a narrowband oscillation. Output `writeup/figures/spindles/fig_spindle_lowband_subbands.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m analysis.spindles.spindle_lowband_subbands`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_spindle_lowband_persession_grid.py` — the most basic spindle finding, one panel per session (4×3 grid, all 12): pure onset-triggered average of CAP 0–3 Hz power (baseline-corrected) around N2 spindle centers, CH bold + CLE/CRE/CLE−CRE faint, shared axes. Every session shows the power rising to a peak at the spindle onset (t=0). Reads cached `spindle_lowband_detection.npz`/`.csv` (no recompute). Output `writeup/figures/spindles/fig_spindle_lowband_persession_grid.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m analysis.spindles.plot_spindle_lowband_persession_grid`.
- **Edited** the canonical manuscript `writeup/main/CAP_sleep_mask_manuscript_main.docx` directly (unzip → edit word/document.xml → rezip) to reflect the simplified Figure 2: swapped the embedded image (media/image3.png, rId8) from the old 3-panel fig7 to `fig2_inband_snr.png` (fixed the display aspect ratio cy 2348029→2759569 EMU for the 2179×1096 PNG), and rewrote all five SNR passages — Methods definition, Results paragraph (dropped "+11 to +27 / +4 to +13 dB vs 3.5–5 Hz floor", added broadband "signal <10 Hz vs noise 10–50 Hz, mean +12.6 dB, 11/12 positive"), Figure 2 caption, Discussion "Physiological band energy", and the appendix figure list. Clean edit (no tracked changes — prior redline already accepted); pre-edit backup saved as `CAP_sleep_mask_manuscript_main_PRE_SNR_backup_20260716.docx`. Verified: document.xml well-formed UTF-8, all new strings present / old absent, zip intact.
- **Added** `writeup/figures/signal_validation/inband_snr.py` — simplified, baseline-free replacement for the manuscript Figure 2 "in-band SNR analysis". Collapses the old 3-panel `fig7_inband_snr.png` (only 3 sessions) and the 3-panel `fig8_simplified_snr.png` into a single-panel bar chart over all 12 sessions. New noise definition (no baseline model needed): signal = full-night power below 10 Hz (where all CAP physiology lives), noise = power from 10 Hz to Nyquist (50 Hz); SNR = 10·log10(P_sig/P_noise) on the raw CLE−CRE full-night Welch PSD (Welch per-segment detrend suppresses the drifting DC baseline). Reads the existing `signal_characterization_cache.pkl` (PSDs already reach Nyquist), so no raw reload. Output `fig2_inband_snr.png` + `inband_snr_summary.csv`. Per-session SNR: mean +12.6 dB, median +11.8, range −0.3 (S5N2) to +22.4 (S4N1); positive in 11/12. **Changed** `scripts/generate_manuscript_docx.py` — Figure 2 now points at `fig2_inband_snr.png` with a rewritten caption + results paragraph; dropped the stale "+11 to +27 dB / +4 to +13 dB vs 3.5–5 Hz floor" resp/cardiac SNR numbers.
- **Added** `analysis/swa_validation/fultz_eeg_cap_impulse.py` — Fultz et al. (Science 2019) style lead-lag / impulse-response test of slow-delta EEG → slow CAP, per the professor's suggestion. Fultz found slow-delta EEG (0.2–4 Hz) envelope LEADS CSF inflow by ~6.4 s via a best-fit impulse response (not a zero-lag correlation); our prior SWA-validation only tested zero-lag spectral agreement (r≈0.015) so it could not have seen a delayed downstream coupling. Method (per session, NREM only): EEG bandpass 0.2–4 Hz → Hilbert envelope → smooth → decimate to 5 Hz (continuous); each CAP channel (CLE, CRE, CH, CLE−CRE OLS) decimated to 5 Hz then slow-bandpassed 0.01–0.1 Hz (Butterworth SOS, filtered continuously then NREM-sliced to avoid per-segment edge transients); contiguous NREM runs ≥120 s from the aligned sleep profile. FFT-based cross-correlation over ±40 s (positive lag = EEG leads CAP), circular-shift null (500×, 95% band), ridge (Tikhonov) impulse response EEG→CAP, and peak-locked average of the EEG envelope at slow-CAP peaks. Caches the 4 needed channels + profile per session to scratchpad `.npz` for fast reruns. First pass S2N2 (390 min NREM): all channels significant vs null but weak — CRE cleanest (|r|=0.15 at +2 s, IR r=0.22 ≈ Fultz's CV 0.22), CLE peak at +6.6 s (≈ Fultz 6.4 s) but |r|=0.08; lag sign inconsistent across channels, CAP-slow has no discrete ~0.05 Hz peak → not yet a clean replication (needs motion/arousal confound control + cohort). Output `analysis/swa_validation/outputs/fultz_eeg_cap_S2N2.png`. Run: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/swa_validation/fultz_eeg_cap_impulse.py --session 3`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_spindle_lowband_allsessions.py` — all-12-session summary of the 0–3 Hz CAP spindle-onset bump, from the cached `spindle_lowband_detection.{npz,csv}` (no recompute). (A) all 12 CH onset-triggered curves + grand mean±SD; (B) per-session onset bump (core dB) bars + per-spindle detection-rate line vs matched-control chance; (C) grand-mean onset response per CAP channel + sigma-at-chance annotation. Result: the onset bump is positive in 12/12 sessions on CH (median +0.48 dB, range 0.15–1.25), all 4 CAP channels bump (+0.43–0.54 dB, CH strongest), while per-spindle detection stays marginal (48–55%). Output `writeup/figures/spindles/fig_spindle_lowband_allsessions.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m analysis.spindles.plot_spindle_lowband_allsessions`.
- **Added** `analysis/mean_value/flow_imbalance_vs_quality.py` — treats the <0.05 Hz L−R baseline (`vlf_CLE-CRE`) as a signed "flow direction" and tests the user hypothesis that one-sided flow across the night predicts worse sleep. Builds on the cached 30-s epoch table `reports/mean_value/mean_value_epochs.csv` (no raw reload). Per session, over the sleep period with top-decile-motion epochs dropped, computes offset-SENSITIVE metrics (`flow_bias`=median operating point, `flow_onesided`=|mean|/rms, `flow_offset_dom`=|median|/std) and offset-INVARIANT dynamics (`flow_skew`/`flow_absskew`, `flow_reversal`=median-crossings/hr, `flow_maxrun`=longest one-sided run); sleep-quality metrics (sleep_eff, WASO, SOL, awakenings, %N3, %REM, fragmentation) derived from hypnogram codes in the same table. Spearman grid (n=12), within-subject de-meaned Spearman (removes fixed per-mount offset → isolates night-to-night state), within-subject paired night check, and a flow-by-stage boxplot. Finds: absolute one-sidedness is offset-dominated (≈0.99 for all sessions → instrumental); offset-invariant dynamics only weakly trend the hypothesized way (p>0.19); signed `flow_bias` correlates strongly with quality (sleep_eff ρ=−0.76) and survives within-subject de-meaning but is exactly the mask-placement-confounded quantity. Outputs `reports/mean_value/{flow_imbalance_session.csv, flow_quality_corr.csv, flow_quality_within_subject.csv}` and figures under `notebooks/plots/mean_value/flow_*.png`, `scatter_*.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/mean_value/flow_imbalance_vs_quality.py`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_spindle_trials_lowband.py` — per-trial (per-spindle-onset) view of the low-band (0–3 Hz) CAP response, showing the detection ON DATA. For one session, recomputes each N2 spindle's ±8 s CH low-band power trace (baseline-corrected, same short-time-spectrogram contrast as `spindle_lowband_detection.py`) plus the contact-EEG sigma trace marking the spindle. Figure: (A) onset-triggered average CH low-band power ±SEM over all N2 spindles (clean +1.2 dB bump at onset on S2N1); (B..) grid of individual spindle trials sorted strongest-first, EEG sigma (grey) + CH low-band (blue), ±1 s core shaded, per-trial dB + detected/not verdict — motion-artifact outliers (|dB|>12) excluded from the picks so examples show the physiological ~0.5–3 dB response. Honestly conveys the ~53% per-trial detection rate. Output `writeup/figures/spindles/fig_spindle_trials_lowband_<session>.png`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m analysis.spindles.plot_spindle_trials_lowband --session S2N1`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/spindle_lowband_detection.py` — per-spindle, onset-level DETECTION-RATE analysis of the low-band (0–3 Hz) CAP response to N2 sleep spindles. Extends the pooled `event_vs_control_auc` in `spindle_analysis.py` to score EACH spindle individually. Per spindle: ±8 s window, short-time spectrogram (nperseg=128, noverlap=96 — identical to `spindle_ersp.py`), band power averaged in dB across bins, then per-spindle dB = (mean core |t|<1 s) − (mean own-baseline |t|>5 s). DETECTION RULE: spindle "detected" if that dB > 0. Bands: low 0–3 Hz (primary, the validated bump), 0.5–3 Hz (env_c variant), sigma 11–16 Hz (built-in negative control). All 4 CAP channels (CLE, CRE, CLE−CRE, CH) + EEG reference, all 12 sessions, N2 spindles. Matched N2 controls (≥3 s from any spindle) scored identically → empirical chance reference. Loads raw sessions (per-spindle core/control windows are not cached). Outputs: 3-panel figure `writeup/figures/spindles/fig_spindle_lowband_detection.png` (A per-session low-band detection-rate bars per channel + chance line; B per-spindle effect-size distributions CH low-band vs sigma; C onset-triggered 0–3 Hz power average, CH bold); CSV `analysis/spindles/outputs/spindle_lowband_detection.csv` (per session + pooled: n_spindles, low-band + 0.5–3 Hz + sigma detection rate & mean dB per channel, empirical null); `spindle_lowband_detection.npz` (per-spindle dB arrays + triggered curves). Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m analysis.spindles.spindle_lowband_detection`.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/resp_vs_swa_band_separation.py` — paper ridge/spectral section: separates the CAP (SEC) spectrum into the respiratory band (0.1–0.5 Hz) and the SWA/delta band (0.5–4 Hz, sub-bands SO 0.5–1 / delta_low 1–2 / delta_high 2–4), and shows the CAP delta/SWA band is cardiac/respiratory (harmonics + baseline wander), NOT cortical slow-wave. Reuses the cached full-night Welch PSDs from `writeup/figures/signal_validation/signal_characterization_cache.pkl` (no raw reload for the PSD decomposition); computes per-window band-power time courses fresh from raw CLE−CRE via `sleep_monitor.spectral.compute_band_power_ratios` (60 s window / 30 s step / 20 s Welch seg, accel motion-gated) for the across-night co-variation test. Metrics per session: resp/SWA and SO/delta_low/delta_high power fractions of 0.1–4 Hz; cardiac(0.5–3)/SWA overlap; spectral-trough separation ratio + trough freq; cardiac fundamental freq; fraction of SWA power on the cardiac harmonic comb (±0.08 Hz); and per-window Spearman ρ(delta,cardiac), ρ(delta,resp), ρ(delta_high,cardiac|resp). Cites the EEG-vs-CAP negative from `analysis/swa_validation/outputs/swa_validation_per_subject.csv`. One 4-panel figure (A mean PSD annotated resp vs SWA sub-bands + cardiac fundamental; B per-session power-fraction stacked bars; C log-log delta-vs-cardiac power scatter; D per-session ρ bars + EEG-negative box) → `writeup/figures/band_separation/resp_vs_swa_band_separation.png`; CSV `resp_vs_swa_band_separation.csv`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe analysis/slow_wave/resp_vs_swa_band_separation.py`.
- **Added** `writeup/figures/signal_validation/signal_characterization.py` — paper signal-validation block covering the three requested items over all 12 sessions, using only the `sleep_monitor` package + raw sessions. (1) **Simplified SNR:** a single per-60 s-window ratio `SNR_band(dB) = 10·log10(mean_PSD_in_band / mean_PSD_in_noise)` on raw broadband CLE−CRE, where each term is a per-Hz density (band power / band width) and the noise reference is a fixed physiology-free 5–10 Hz band, so the ratio is bandwidth-independent and easy to state in Methods. (2) **Mean-capacitance drift:** the <0.01 Hz DC baseline of raw CLE/CRE/CH via decimate-to-1 Hz + rolling median, plotted centered on each channel's session median with IQR-robust y-limits (sensor-dropout spikes clip off-screen; DC span reported in each title). (3) **Frequency characteristics:** 12-session-average Welch PSD per channel, per-session spectral centroid per band, and per-session band-power fractions. Loads each session once, caches lightweight per-session summaries to `signal_characterization_cache.pkl` (pass `--recompute` to rebuild) so figures re-tune without reloading raw data. Outputs `fig8_simplified_snr.png`, `fig9_mean_capacitance_drift.png`, `fig10_frequency_characteristics.png`, `signal_characterization_summary.csv`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe writeup/figures/signal_validation/signal_characterization.py`.

## 2026-07-09

- **Changed** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_trial_examples.py` — per-session saved trial plots now include the RAW CAP + PSG waveforms at high resolution. For each example trial, in addition to the compact epoch-level overview (`examples/<sess>.png`), writes a full-width high-res figure `examples/<sess>_trial<NNN>.png` (dpi 150, 18in wide) stacking: stage strip + C1/C3 criteria (epoch) then raw 100 Hz signals — CAP CLE/CRE/CH (demeaned) and PSG EEG (0.3–40 Hz bandpassed for readability), ECG, Thorax, Flow, Pleth — over the trial ±5 min, trial shaded green with head-movement markers. Loads each raw session once via `load_session` (added `--n` for #examples/session and `--overview-only` to skip the raw figures). Shows the pre-onset head movement as large Thorax/Flow artifacts followed by regular breathing + quiet CAP inside the trial.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_spindle_windows_all.py` — writes ONE per-spindle window figure for every spindle in a session (single-column: EEG raw / EEG 11–16 / CLE-CRE,CLE,CRE,CH 11–16 / CAP spectrogram, ±3 s, span shaded; title = spindle #, stage, time, freq, dur) into a per-session subfolder `outputs/spindle_windows_<label>[_N2]/spindle_<NNNN>_<t>h.png`. `--n2-only` flag restricts to N2. Ran on S2N1 → 1,871 figures. Filters signals once per session; ~progress every 100.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/spindle_ersp_control.py` + `plot_ersp_control.py` — controls for the CAP 0–3 Hz spindle bump. Reuses `session_ersp`; adds a `Classification Arousal` loader (same wall-clock alignment as spindles). Computes core-vs-baseline spectra for 5 conditions (spindle / random-N2 null / N2 arousals / spindle-with-arousal±5s / spindle-without-arousal) on CH + CLE-CRE. Result: random-N2 flat (CH +0.06 dB) and arousal-free spindles still bump (CH +0.43) → the bump is a genuine spindle-locked mechanical signature, not an artifact or arousal confound. Outputs `fig_spindle_ersp_control.png`, `spindle_ersp_control.npz/.csv`.
- **Changed** `analysis/spindles/plot_ersp.py` — corrected the two ERSP suptitles (were "no CAP transient at any frequency"; now state the validated 0–3 Hz spindle-locked bump).
- **Added** `scripts/analyze_k_biomarker_perwindow.py` — per-window k as a *secondary* biomarker (cache-only, `artifacts/mask_phase_a.parquet`; no raw reprocessing). Reproduces the rate confound of the supervised `k_gt = peaks_loose/GT` (within-session corr with rate = −0.845 cardiac / −0.561 resp), then defines a GT-free deployable marker `M = peaks_loose/hilbert` ("morphological multiplicity") that is rate-flat (within-session corr ≈ +0.08 card / +0.03 resp) and its rate-residual `k_resid`. Tests M with within-session/LOSO statistics only: lag-1 autocorr vs 200× epoch-shuffle null, within-session Kruskal-Wallis + Friedman direction-consistency (contrasted against the inflated pooled p), night1-vs-night2 ICC(1), and LOSO one-vs-rest logistic AUC (N3, REM). Outputs `reports/rates/mask/k_biomarker_perwindow.csv` (18,638-row marker table for downstream joins), `reports/rates/mask/k_biomarker_stats.csv`, `writeup/figures/mask_rate_detection/fig_k_biomarker.png`. NOT wired into the rate pipeline — Fig 9 keeps static per-session k. Run: `C:/Users/adity/anaconda3/python.exe scripts/analyze_k_biomarker_perwindow.py`.
- **Added** `scripts/cap_swa_trial_viewer.py` — interactive Plotly Dash browser for the CAP-SWA trials (companion to `session_viewer.py`, runs on port 8051). Driven entirely by `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/trials/{trial_epochs.parquet, trials.csv}` so it starts instantly. Whole-night overview per session (hypnogram + CLE/CRE/CH means + C1/C3 hold criteria + HR + EEG delta) with every trial shaded green and a clickable onset marker; clicking a marker (or picking from the trial dropdown) pops that trial's pre/trial/post detail (6-panel, ±5 min, head-movement markers) into a panel below while the whole-night stays visible. Auto-saves the whole-night PNG on each session load; "Export ALL" button and `--export-all` CLI write every session's whole-night PNG + all 59 trial-window PNGs (via matplotlib — kaleido not installed). Outputs -> `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/trials/viewer_exports/{<sess>_wholenight.png, <sess>/trial_NNN.png}`. Run: `.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/cap_swa_trial_viewer.py` then open http://localhost:8051.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/spindle_ersp.py` + `plot_ersp.py` — spindle-triggered ERSP (baseline-corrected time-frequency, 0–45 Hz, ±8 s) for EEG + all CAP channels; hypothesis-free "does any band change vs its own baseline". EEG shows sigma; CAP shows no sigma but a small 0–3 Hz bump (see ANALYSIS_LOG). `session_ersp` bugfix: separate `faxis` variable so the returned freq axis is the filtered 58-bin one (was returning the unfiltered 65-bin axis → per-session IndexError). Outputs `fig_spindle_ersp_maps.png`, `fig_spindle_ersp_spectra.png`, `spindle_ersp.npz`, `spindle_ersp.csv`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_spindle_windows.py` — single-event spindle windows: for the N strongest N2 spindles in a session, plots EEG raw + EEG 11–16 Hz + CAP 11–16 Hz for every channel (CLE−CRE, CLE, CRE, CH) + a CAP sigma spectrogram over a shared ±3 s window with the scored spindle span shaded. Shows event-level (not just averaged) that no CAP channel carries sigma. Output `outputs/fig_spindle_windows_<label>.png`.
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/spindle_indirect.py` — two follow-up tests over all 12 sessions, all CAP channels. #3 heart-rate route: spindle-triggered instantaneous HR from ECG R-peaks (positive control) vs CAP cardiac-band pulse peaks for each of CLE−CRE/CLE/CRE/CH, ±15 s, with a random-N2 null. #2 coherence route: whole-night magnitude-squared coherence EEG↔{CLE−CRE,CLE,CRE,CH} (leakage test) and CLE↔CRE (same-source anchor). Writes `spindle_hr_route.csv`, `spindle_coherence.csv`, `spindle_hr_triggered.npz`, `spindle_coherence.npz` (per-channel columns/keys).
- **Added** `analysis/spindles/plot_indirect.py` — figures for the two routes, all channels: `fig_spindle_hr_triggered.png` (2×3 — ECG biphasic ±~1.4 bpm spindle-cardiac beat, every CAP channel flat vs null) and `fig_spindle_coherence.png` (all EEG-CAP pairs ≈0 incl. sigma; CLE-CRE anchor peaks at resp/cardiac, proving the estimator works).
- **Changed** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_trials.py` — REDEFINED trials to the user's exact 3-point criteria: C1 slow mean drift of a SINGLE capacitive channel (CLE/CRE/CH, not the CLE−CRE difference; "or" = min |slope| across channels), C2 trial INITIATED BY A HEAD MOVEMENT (accel event ≤3 epochs before onset), C3 low-variance/slow thorax. Dropped the prior quiescence-throughout hold condition — the accelerometer now supplies the movement trigger. Recomputes single-channel DC means + movements from raw sessions; physiology merged from the aligned cap_swa parquet (100% stage agreement). q=0.5 → 59 movement-initiated trials (was 91): more selective, more N3-enriched (2.15× vs 1.71×), stronger bradycardia (HR ↓ 6/6, −2.2 BPM vs −1.3). Outputs overwrite the prior trials/ files.
- **Changed** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_trial_examples.py` — example panels updated for the new criteria: single-channel CLE/CRE/CH means (demeaned) replace the CLE−CRE mean, hold criteria show C1/C3 sub-scores, and head-movement events are marked (orange), highlighting the initiating movement before each trial onset.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_trial_examples.py` — per-session example-trial figures with pre/post context. For each session picks a few representative trials (ranked by N3 content then duration) and plots each with a 5-min pad before/after: stage strip, the three criteria sub-scores (+ q line), CLE−CRE mean (D1), HR, EEG delta, thorax+accel. Trial span shaded, onset/offset marked. Shows the trials are bounded by movement/DC-step events (thorax+accel spike and a CLE−CRE mean step at offset) with flat DC + quiescence + elevated EEG delta inside. Outputs `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/trials/examples/<session>.png` (12 sessions).
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_trials.py` — TRIAL-based (observational) analysis of the CAP-SWA definition, per user request: instead of the graded geometric-mean score fed to a classifier, find discrete windows where the three mechanical criteria (D1 slow CLE−CRE DC slope, D3 slow thorax amplitude, Dq low accel RMS) ALL hold as a conjunction — each per-session sub-score ≥ q — in sustained runs of ≥4 epochs, treat each run as a trial, and characterize the trials. Reads the existing `all_epoch_features.parquet` (no re-extraction). **Findings (q=0.5): 91 trials, median 3.0 min (max 10.5), 15.5% of the night, 11–19 per subject.** Trials are predominantly consolidated NREM, NOT N3-specific: 67% of trial epochs are N2, 15% N3, 13% N1 (95% NREM); N3 enriched 1.7× over base rate, Wake depleted to 0.31×, REM to 0.68×. Stricter conjunction purifies toward N3 (q=0.7 → 2.8× N3 enrichment but only 9 trials covering 9% of N3). Physiology during trials reproduces the graded-score signature (per-subject direction): HR ↓ 6/6 (−1.3 BPM, bradycardia), EEG delta ↑ 5/6, thorax amplitude ↓ 4/6, CAP cardiac freq ↑ 6/6, PPG−CAP divergence reverses 6/6, RR flat. Onset-triggered averages show HR/accel/thorax dipping to a trough at trial onset while EEG delta climbs and stays elevated — entry into a deep, quiet, delta-rich state. Outputs: `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/trials/{trials.csv, trial_epochs.parquet, stage_composition.csv, physiology_contrasts.csv, onset_triggered.csv, cap_swa_trials.png, per_session/<sess>.png}`. Manuscript not edited.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/ladder_bands_spectrogram.py` — side-by-side band-isolated ladder view: CH + CRE spectrograms with respiratory-band rungs (cyan, Δf 0.12–0.5) and cardiac-band rungs (magenta, Δf 0.5–1.6) drawn on the members, plus a per-channel ladder-occupancy timeline. Supports `--zoom`. Visually confirms the channel dissociation (CH cardiac-dominant, CRE respiratory-dominant) and the intermittent, episode-clustered nature of ladders. Outputs `reports/slow_wave/ladder_quantify/ladder_bands_<session>[_zoom].png`.
- **Changed** `analysis/slow_wave/ladder_spectrogram.py` — `comb_fit` gains `df_lo`/`df_hi` (spacing band) and `max_min_k` (require a rung at k≤max_min_k so a banded spacing cannot be fit to only high harmonics of the other rhythm). `analysis/slow_wave/ladder_quantify.py` now runs combined + resp + cardiac modes independently per window/channel and writes `summary_by_band.csv`.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/show_ladder_examples.py` — per-window waveform + fine PSD with detected ladder members and k·f0 guides, for eyeballing whether a detection is a real ladder. Surfaced that the integer-ratio member count over-counts (grabs non-contiguous high-order cardiac ridges as respiratory harmonics).
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/ladder_spectrogram.py` — CH spectrogram + persistent-ridge overlay + comb-fit ladder quantifier (single session viz). `comb_fit()`: ladder = equally-spaced prominent ridges; searches Δf, scores n_rungs × span-coverage, refines Δf by least squares, flags harmonic (comb through 0) vs inharmonic. Δf search 0.15–1.6 Hz, prominence filter ≥2× floor.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/ladder_quantify.py` — multichannel batch quantifier (CH/CLE/CRE, all 12 sessions). Per-window per-channel comb ladders; a window carries a ladder if any channel detects ≥3 rungs. Band split (respiratory f0<0.6 vs cardiac), harmonic/inharmonic, per-stage prevalence, per-channel comparison.
- **Output** `reports/slow_wave/ladder_quantify/{per_window_channels.parquet, per_window_combined.parquet, summary.csv, channel_ladder_counts.csv}`; per-session `reports/slow_wave/harmonic_rigor/ladder_spectrogram_<session>.png`.
- **Key result** Clean prominent ladders are intermittent (2% of non-motion windows, up to 20% S6N2), correcting the loose 85%. Channel dissociation: CH→cardiac ladder (f0~1.1 Hz), CRE→respiratory ladder (f0~0.3 Hz), CLE negligible. 76% cardiac / 24% respiratory; 63% harmonic / 37% inharmonic.

- **Added** `writeup/figures/cap_swa/make_cap_swa_figure.py` + `fig_cap_swa_definition.png` — publication figure for the CAP-SWA mechanical/autonomic definition (from cached cap_swa outputs, no recompute). Four panels: (A) per-subject swa_score→N3 AUC (6/6 above chance, mean 0.675), (B) HR non-SWA→CAP-SWA per subject (bradycardia), (C) professor-hypotheses table (predicted vs observed direction + per-subject consistency + verdict), (D) threshold sweep showing 0.60 at the F1 maximum.
- **Added** `writeup/edits/cap_swa_section_draft.md` — ready-to-paste manuscript Methods + Results (Part C) + Table + Discussion for the CAP-SWA definition. Honest-negative framing: mask does not measure cortical SWA (§3.5) or spindles (§3.6), but the mechanical/autonomic score marks N3 with consistent cross-subject direction (per-subject AUC 0.675, 6/6); five of six autonomic hypotheses contradicted (HR bradycardia not tachycardia, k-deviation shrinks, PPG/CAP divergence reverses, RR flat, movement does not precede onset), EEG delta up as a weak trend. Per-subject direction counts as evidence per OUTLINE rule 3. Manuscript docx not edited.

- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/swa_classifier_experiment.py` — CAP-SWA classifier ablation + definition tuning (Workstream C, steps 1–2). Loads the self-consistent `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/all_epoch_features.parquet`; PART A runs a LOSO N3 ablation (direct-score AUC + logistic + GBM) over nested feature sets (swa_score / swa_subscores / mechanical); PART B sweeps the swa_score threshold (0.40–0.85, sustained-bout vs raw) reporting precision/recall/F1; PART C sweeps the geometric-mean sub-score weighting over the simplex reporting pooled + per-subject N3 AUC. Adds a `direct_score_auc()` helper — a depth-3 GBM on one continuous feature ties its outputs and spuriously deflates AUC toward 0.5, so the composite score is reported directly (tie-free). **Key results:** per-subject `swa_score`→N3 AUC 0.675 ± 0.073 [0.575, 0.759], 6/6 subjects above chance (consistent cross-subject direction, unlike ridge/HER/mean-value); mechanical set 0.692 per-subject; CAP-only (slow-DC + quiescence, no PSG thorax belt) pooled 0.666 / per-subject 0.671 ± 0.042; the 0.60 threshold is F1-optimal (0.281); equal sub-score weighting is within 0.015 of the swept optimum. **Note:** deliberately does NOT fuse with the May-28 `sws_features.parquet` cache — that cache uses an older epoch/stage alignment (~43% stage-label disagreement) that misaligns the join and drove full_cap below chance; a valid fusion requires re-extraction (flagged in ANALYSIS_LOG). Manuscript not edited.
- **Output** `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/classifier/{loso_ablation.csv, loso_ablation_folds.csv, threshold_sweep.csv, weighting_sweep.csv, classifier_experiment.png}`.

- **Added** `analysis/mean_value/mean_value_vs_stage.py` — professor Results-opener directive ("start with mean value / raw signal changes vs sleep stages"). Per-30s-epoch DC mean + <0.05 Hz VLF baseline for CLE/CRE/CLE-CRE across 12 sessions; per-session z-score, slow-trend-removed and motion-clean variants; Kruskal-Wallis per stage, per-subject direction-consistency check, LOSO AUC; spectrogram+hypnogram+mean-trace overlays. Finding: significant pooled association (KW p up to 1e-25, survives detrending/motion controls) but **subject-dependent in direction** (no unanimous contrast) with near-chance LOSO AUC (0.40–0.57) — not a universal biomarker; suitable only as within-subject descriptive context. Manuscript not edited.
- **Changed** `analysis/mean_value/mean_value_vs_stage.py` — extended mean-value analysis to **all channels + accelerometer**: added CLE+CRE average and acc_mag as mean-value channels (now CLE, CRE, CLE-CRE, CLE+CRE, acc); per-subject direction check and LOSO AUC now looped over every channel; per-channel boxplot + subject-direction heatmap figures. Confirms/strengthens the original verdict: every channel is significant when pooled (KW p 1e-4 → 1e-31) but **all stage contrasts are subject-dependent** across all 5 channels (only exception: CLE+CRE Wake-vs-sleep, 6/6 subjects lower, yet still near-chance LOSO AUC 0.55); LOSO AUC across all channels/contrasts spans 0.29–0.61 (chance). acc mean tracks head posture, not stage (Wake not highest). Stage ordering flips between raw and detrended for CRE/CLE+CRE, confirming overnight drift dominates.
- **Output** `reports/mean_value/{mean_value_epochs.csv, mean_value_stage_stats.csv, mean_value_subject_direction.csv, mean_value_loso_auc.csv}`; `notebooks/plots/mean_value/{spectrogram_hypno_*, meanvalue_hypno_*, boxplot_<ch>[_detr], subject_direction_<ch>}.png` for ch ∈ {CLE, CRE, CLE_CRE, CLEplusCRE, acc}.
- **Added** `analysis/mean_value/raw_stats_vs_stage.py` — extends the mean-value study to a spanning set of time-domain per-window raw statistics vs stage, all 5 channels: level (mean), dispersion (std, iqr), trend (slope_win within-epoch, slope_vlf <0.05 Hz baseline slope), roughness (linelen), complexity (Hjorth mobility, complexity), shape (skew, kurt). Per (stat×channel): Kruskal-Wallis, per-subject direction consistency, LOSO AUC; overview figure = LOSO-AUC grid (stat×channel) per contrast. **Key result — first cross-subject-consistent CAP stage signal:** dispersion + complexity statistics separate **Wake vs sleep** robustly and 6/6-consistently (std/mobility/complexity LOSO AUC 0.72–0.77 on CAP channels, 0.65–0.71 on acc) — an arousal/movement detector that generalizes across subjects, unlike the DC mean (0.55, subject-dependent). N3-vs-rest is weak-but-consistent for Hjorth mobility/complexity (AUC 0.60–0.66, 6/6). REM and the slope/skew/kurt families stay near chance; slope medians do not separate stages (only their Wake-time variability, already captured by std). Manuscript not edited.
- **Output** `reports/mean_value/{raw_stats_epochs.csv, raw_stats_kw.csv, raw_stats_subject_direction.csv, raw_stats_loso_auc.csv}`; `notebooks/plots/mean_value/{loso_grid_<contrast>, boxplot_{std,slope_vlf}_CLE_CRE, subject_direction_{std,slope_vlf}_CLE_CRE}.png`.
- **Changed** `analysis/mean_value/mean_value_vs_stage.py` — generic boxplot title ("Per-window {feat} by stage") so the reused figure helper reads correctly for non-mean statistics.

- **Changed** `writeup/main/CAP_sleep_mask_manuscript_main.docx` — addressed professor review markup. (1) Fixed section numbering: Results subsections renumbered 3.1–3.5 → 4.1–4.5 (were duplicating Methods), Discussion 4→5, Limitations 5→6, Conclusion 6→7 (headings only; no cross-refs affected — in-text fields are EndNote citations). (2) Removed remaining informal "battery" jargon in prose ("extensive battery"→"suite"; "Tracking battery:"→"Tracking evaluation:"; figure caption "(tracking battery)"→"(tracking evaluation)"), preserving the `symmetric_tracking_battery.csv` filename. Still open: professor's directive to open Results with a raw-signal mean-value vs sleep-stage analysis (analysis in progress). Untouched original backed up in session scratchpad.
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/harmonic_rigor.py` — harmonic rigor (Workstream B). Shared `best_ladder()` scorer; per-session per-k surrogate null (random ridge frequencies) with 95th-pct threshold; strong-ladder criterion (≥3 members, ratio_tol 0.06) that beats the null; calibrated confidence (ratio_quality × amplitude-decay-monotonicity); non-ladder window classification (motion/quiet/single-tone/broadband/multi-non-harmonic) cross-tabbed against sleep stage; survival + confidence + otherwise-by-stage summary figure.
- **Output** `reports/slow_wave/harmonic_rigor/{ladder_windows.parquet, null_summary.csv, otherwise_crosstab.csv, harmonic_rigor.png}`.

- **Changed** `sleep_monitor/harmonics.py` — `detect_persistent_ridges()` now stashes the pre-smoothing peak trace (`freq_trace_raw`) and computes per-ridge flatness/consistency metrics (`freq_std`, `freq_cv`, `drift_slope`, `coverage`, `flatness`) in a new Step 5e. Additive keys only; existing consumers unaffected (test suite: 90 pass, 1 pre-existing unrelated preprocessing failure).
- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/ridge_consolidation.py` — ridge consolidation (Workstream A). Baseline-vs-flat-favoring config comparison (flat-ridge yield + cross-session reproducibility); per-ridge table with flatness + dominant stage; per-window ridge features vs ALL five stages (KW + one-vs-rest AUC + per-subject direction); flatness-by-stage + AUC-heatmap summary figure.
- **Output** `reports/slow_wave/ridge_consolidation/{per_ridge.csv, per_epoch_features.parquet, stage_association.csv, retune_comparison.csv, ridge_consolidation.png}`.

- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/cap_swa_definition.py` — CAP-SWA operational definition (Workstream C). Per-epoch mechanical/physiology/validation feature extraction; graded SWA score (percentile geometric mean of slow-DC + slow-thorax + quiescence sub-scores); binary sustained-bout candidate label; movement-initiation precursor test with matched-random null (H2); per-subject SWA-vs-non-SWA contrast for the professor's autonomic hypotheses (H4 HR, H5 RR, H6 CAP/thorax k-deviation, H7 PPG-vs-CAP cardiac freq, H8 EEG delta) with Bonferroni; SWA-score N3 AUC.
- **Output** `reports/slow_wave/cap_swa/<session>/epoch_features.csv` + `night_overview.png` (12 sessions), `all_epoch_features.parquet`, `hypothesis_summary.csv`, `movement_initiation.csv`.

- **Added** `analysis/slow_wave/paper_ridge_demo.py` — paper-ready harmonic ridge demo: (A) per-session spectrogram + ridge overlay with hypnogram, (B) pooled quantification (violin, heatmap, ROC, KW/MW-U), (C) Stage 4 LOSO N3 classifier (RF, 4 ridge features). Completes all 4 stages of the harmonic structure detection plan.

## 2026-06-17

- **Added** `scripts/analyze_adaptive_k_and_oracle.py` — cache-only follow-up analysis (no raw reprocessing): self-supervised adaptive k(t), per-epoch oracle headroom (channel/method/full), channel-win distribution. Outputs CSVs in `reports/rates/mask/` + figs 7-9.
- **Added** `CONTINUATION_RATE_DETECTION.md` — handoff doc for next CLI session (cache locations, findings, prioritized next steps)
- **Output** `writeup/figures/mask_rate_detection/fig{7,8,9}*.png` — oracle headroom, adaptive k, channel diversity
- **Key finding** Cardiac channel-diversity oracle = 1.58 BPM (vs fused 3.91) — large untapped headroom; resp headroom is method-diversity not channel (oracle-method 0.54). Self-sup adaptive k fails for cardiac (no good anchor).
- **Added** `scripts/run_mask_rate_detection.py` — paper-ready mask rate detection pipeline (6 phases: raw rates, Smart Fusion + multi-channel SQI, k-calibration + smoothing, evaluation, failure analysis, multi-channel value). Checkpointed at each phase (parquet). Generates 9 paper figures + per-session CSV.
- **Output** `writeup/figures/mask_rate_detection/` — 9 figures (pipeline progression, Bland-Altman, per-stage MAE, time series best/worst × 2 bands, failure analysis, multi-channel value)
- **Output** `reports/rates/mask/` — per-session CSV, final_summary.json, pipeline log

## 2026-06-11 (cont.)

### Best-of-Both Rate Pipeline + Updated Documentation
- **Added** `scripts/evaluate_best_pipeline.py` — unified best pipeline: Kalman (reactive, R x0.3, Q x2.0) for resp, hilbert for cardiac, multi-channel quality-weighted fusion, configurable median temporal smoothing (SMOOTH_WIN=7), per-session + LOSO k-calibration
- **Output** `reports/rates/best_pipeline/` — 12 time-series PNGs, 12 Bland-Altman PNGs, aggregate + per-stage plots, 2 CSVs
- Resp: **1.49 br/min** (per-session k), 1.95 (LOSO) — 42% over peaks/k baseline
- Cardiac: **4.11 BPM** (per-session k), 5.41 (LOSO) — 15% over single-channel hilbert/k
- **Updated** `scripts/generate_rate_consolidation_docx.py` — now two-part document: Part 1 (original consolidation) + Part 2 (hybrid pipeline with all 12 session time-series, Bland-Altman, aggregate stats, per-stage, 4 tables)
- **Output** `writeup/CAP_rate_consolidation_section.docx` — 35 figures, 4 tables

### SWA Validation — Lucey et al. 2019 Replication (Steps 0-4)
- **Added** `analysis/swa_validation/swa_pipeline.py` — shared spectral pipeline: FIR bandpass (0.5-40 Hz via `firwin`), 6-sec epoch Welch PSD, band powers (1-4.5 Hz total, sub-bands, 20-30 Hz EMG), relative power normalization, artifact rejection (EMG 97.5th pct + accelerometer)
- **Added** `analysis/swa_validation/run_swa_validation.py` — full pipeline runner: Steps 1-2 (process all 12 sessions, both EEG and CAP), Step 3 (Pearson/Spearman correlation, Bland-Altman, coherence, ROC/AUC for N3 detection), Step 4 (per-subject summary, 5 publication plots)
- **Added** `analysis/swa_validation/step0_inventory.py` — data inventory scanner
- **Fixed** `swa_pipeline.py:bandpass_fir()` — replaced `firls` with `firwin`: `firls` with narrow 0.1 Hz transition band at 0.5 Hz produced catastrophically ill-conditioned coefficients (range ±2794, signal amplification ×26M). `firwin` window method is numerically stable (coefficients ±0.16 to 0.79)
- **Fixed** `sleep_monitor/loader.py:load_session()` — removed `unit='ms', utc=True` from `pd.to_datetime()` call (was causing `time_start` to always be None for datetime strings)
- **Fixed** `sleep_monitor/loader.py:load_sleep_profile()` — complete rewrite: now parses wall-clock timestamps from Sleep Profile epochs and computes offset from CSV `timeSM` start time, handles midnight crossing, drops out-of-range epochs. Previously assumed epoch 0 = CSV time 0, causing up to 38.5 min misalignment
- **Output** `analysis/swa_validation/outputs/` — `swa_validation_results.csv`, `swa_validation_per_subject.csv`, 5 PNGs (swa_overlay, bland_altman, coherence, roc_curves, correlation_scatter)
- **Result**: Negative — CAP temple differential does not measure cortical SWA (r≈0, coherence≈0, N3 AUC≈0.5). EEG sanity check confirms pipeline correctness (AUC=0.740).

### Hybrid Rate Pipeline — Phase 2: Multi-Channel Fusion
- **Added** `scripts/evaluate_multichannel.py` — runs spectral + adaptive_peaks → Kalman on 5 channels (CLE, CRE, CH, avg, diff) independently, quality-weighted fusion across channels, oracle (best per-window)
- **Output** `reports/rates/hybrid_phase2/` — 28 PNGs (per-session channel comparison, aggregate bars, heatmaps), 2 CSVs
- Resp: multi-ch 1.82 br/min (vs single-best 1.90, oracle 1.21) — 4% improvement
- Cardiac: multi-ch 17.74 BPM (vs single-best 21.22, oracle 8.63) — 16% improvement
- Oracle headroom shows substantial gains possible with better channel selection

### Hybrid Rate Pipeline — Phase 3: Formal Evaluation

- **Updated** `analysis/slow_wave/run_ridge_overlay.py`:
  - `MIN_PERSIST_SEC` 180→300 (5 min minimum ridge)
  - Added `compute_fine_spectrogram()` — high-res visual background (nperseg=2048, nfft=4096)
  - Replaced harmonic-ladder scoring with prominence-based scoring throughout
  - Ridges colored by prominence (SNR vs floor) instead of raw amplitude; labels show "freq (Nx)"
  - Removed ladder dots, pick_best_channel, plot_multichannel_comparison
  - 6-row stacked layout, motion as red semi-transparent overlay, output to `reports/slow_wave/overlay/`
  - Figure size 22x20 at 200 DPI
- **Deleted** old superseded outputs: `harmonics_*.png`, `harmonic_ladders_*.png/.parquet`, `ridge_multichannel_*.png` from `reports/slow_wave/`

- **Output** `reports/rates/hybrid_phase1/` — 24 time-series PNGs, 24 Bland-Altman PNGs, 4 aggregate plots, 2 CSVs

### Hybrid Rate Pipeline — Phase 0: Adaptive Peak Detector
- **Added** `rate_adaptive_peaks()` in `sleep_monitor/rates.py` — spectral-guided, amplitude-adaptive peak detector with IPI validation. Uses spectral peak for min_distance, rolling MAD for prominence, and inter-peak-interval CV check with MAD-based outlier rejection.
- **Updated** `sleep_monitor/config.py` — added `adaptive_peaks` to METHOD_NAMES, METHOD_LABELS, METHOD_COLORS
- **Updated** `sleep_monitor/__init__.py` — exported `rate_adaptive_peaks`
